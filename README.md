# VPAA - ASC - Bootstrap Styles Project

This is a direct descendant of utsa-bootstrap and uses the official UTSA Bootstrap Styles as a base. The purpose of this project is to create a standard pattern library using the seed.css from UTSA's Seed Site CMS as a starting point.


### Getting Started ###

- Develop locally using ```gulp```
  - Your generated override styles are in app/styles/seed
- Prepare for deployment by using ```gulp build```
  - Built assets will be placed in the dist folder
- Use built assets in CMS
